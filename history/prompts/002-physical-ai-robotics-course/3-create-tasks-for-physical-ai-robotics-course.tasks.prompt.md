## Prompt

great plan for module 1 ready, now make it's tasks for to get better result in detailed implementation.

## Response snapshot

I have generated the `tasks.md` file for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" course.

You can find the file at `specs/002-physical-ai-robotics-course/tasks.md`.

The tasks are broken down by user story and include setup and polish phases. The file also includes dependency information and parallel execution examples.

Total tasks: 19
Tasks for User Story 1: 8
Tasks for User Story 2: 2

The MVP is User Story 1.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created the `tasks.md` file with a detailed breakdown of tasks for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" course.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run for this operation.
- 📁 Files: 
  - `specs/002-physical-ai-robotics-course/tasks.md`
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for the next command.
- 🧠 Reflection: The `tasks.md` file provides a clear and actionable plan for implementing the course content.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): None
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): None
