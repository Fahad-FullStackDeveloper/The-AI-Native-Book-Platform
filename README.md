# The AI Native Book Platform

This project is an innovative platform for creating and consuming "living books" powered by AI. It leverages a Spec-Driven Development (SDD) approach to build a comprehensive learning experience, starting with a course on "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics." The platform integrates AI at its core, from content generation to interactive user experiences.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Backend (Chatbot & AI Agents):** [Python](https://www.python.org/), [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- **Backend (User Auth):** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
- **Styling:** CSS Modules, Custom CSS
- **Development Workflow:** Spec-Driven Development (SDD) with Gemini CLI

## Key Features

- **AI-Generated Content:** Course materials, such as the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" book, are generated by AI based on detailed specifications.
- **Interactive Chatbot:** A book-specific chatbot allows users to ask questions and get answers based on the content, enhancing the learning experience.
- **User Authentication:** Users can sign up and log in to the platform to access personalized content and features.
- **Spec-Driven Development:** The entire project is built using a structured, specification-first approach, ensuring clarity, quality, and alignment with goals.
- **Modular Course Structure:** Content is organized into modules and weekly breakdowns, providing a clear learning path.
