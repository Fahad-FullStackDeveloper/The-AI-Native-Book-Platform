# The AI Native Book Platform

This project is an innovative platform for creating and consuming "living books" powered by AI. It leverages a Spec-Driven Development (SDD) approach to build a comprehensive learning experience, starting with a course on "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics." The platform integrates AI at its core, from content generation to interactive user experiences.

## Hackathon Goals

This project is being developed as part of a hackathon with the following goals:

1.  **AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation:** Write a book using Docusaurus and deploy it to GitHub Pages.
    - **Status:** `In Progress`. A Docusaurus book is set up, and content for "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" has been generated and structured.

2.  **Integrated RAG Chatbot Development:** Build and embed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot within the book to answer questions about the content.
    - **Status:** `In Progress`. A Python/FastAPI backend (`/textbackend`) has been initiated, and a frontend `BookChatbot` component exists.

3.  **Bonus: Signup and Signin:** Implement user authentication. At signup, collect user background information to enable personalization.
    - **Status:** `In Progress`. Frontend components for Login/Signup (`/src/pages/login.tsx`, `src/pages/signup.tsx`) and a Node.js authentication server (`/server`) have been created.

4.  **Bonus: Reusable Intelligence:** Create and use reusable intelligence via Claude Code Subagents and Agent Skills in the book project.
    - **Status:** `In Progress`. The `/textbackend` directory shows a preliminary structure for agents and skills.

5.  **Bonus: Content Personalization:** Allow logged-in users to personalize chapter content based on their background.
    - **Status:** `Not Started`.

6.  **Bonus: Urdu Translation:** Allow logged-in users to translate chapter content into Urdu.
    - **Status:** `Not Started`.
