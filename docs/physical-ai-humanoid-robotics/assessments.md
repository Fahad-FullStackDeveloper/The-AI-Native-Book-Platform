# Assessments

Your performance in this course will be evaluated through a combination of hands-on labs, theoretical quizzes, and a comprehensive final capstone project. The goal is to assess both your practical robotics skills and your conceptual understanding of Physical AI.

### Grading Breakdown

| Component | Weight | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Module Labs (4)** | 40% | Practical assignments at the end of each module, submitted as code repositories with video demonstrations. |
| **Quizzes (4)** | 20% | Short, multiple-choice quizzes to test your understanding of key theoretical concepts from each module. |
| **Capstone Project** | 35% | A multi-week project where you will design, simulate, and deploy an autonomous humanoid robot task. |
| **Participation** | 5% | Active engagement in class discussions and peer-review of lab submissions. |

### 1. Module Labs (40%)

Each of the four modules concludes with a hands-on lab assignment. These labs are designed to build upon each other, culminating in the skills needed for the final capstone project.

*   **Lab 1: The Robotic Nervous System:**
    *   **Task:** Create a ROS 2 package that controls a simple URDF model. Implement a publisher/subscriber and a service/client for basic robot interaction.
    *   **Submission:** A link to a GitHub repository containing your ROS 2 package.

*   **Lab 2: The Digital Twin:**
    *   **Task:** Design a simple environment in Gazebo or Unity. Import your URDF model and write a script to control its joints and interact with the simulated world.
    *   **Submission:** Your environment files and control scripts, along with a short video demonstrating the interaction.

*   **Lab 3: The AI-Robot Brain:**
    *   **Task:** Implement a VSLAM algorithm using NVIDIA Isaac ROS on a simulated robot. Navigate the robot from a start to a goal point in a known map using Nav2.
    *   **Submission:** Your ROS 2 launch files, configuration, and a video of the successful navigation.

*   **Lab 4: Vision-Language-Action:**
    *   **Task:** Integrate a voice command system using Whisper to trigger a sequence of actions in your simulated robot.
    *   **Submission:** Your integrated code and a video of you giving a voice command and the robot executing the task.

### 2. Quizzes (20%)

At the end of each module, a short quiz will be administered to test your knowledge of the core concepts. These quizzes will be multiple-choice and will be taken online.

### 3. Capstone Project (35%)

The capstone project is the centerpiece of this course. You will work in small teams to develop an "Autonomous Humanoid" that can perform a complex task in a simulated environment.

*   **Phase 1: Project Proposal (5%):** A detailed document outlining your project goals, the task your robot will perform, and the technical approach you will take.
*   **Phase 2: Mid-term Demo (10%):** A live demonstration of your robot's basic mobility and perception capabilities in the simulation.
*   **Phase 3: Final Submission & Demo (20%):** The final project submission, including all code, documentation, and a comprehensive video demonstration of your autonomous humanoid successfully completing its task.

### 4. Participation (5%)

Active participation is crucial for success in this course. This includes:
*   Asking and answering questions in class.
*   Participating in code reviews of your peers' lab submissions.
*   Contributing to a shared repository of useful resources and tools.
