# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Focus: Physics simulation and environment building.

In this module, we will delve into the world of digital twins, creating realistic simulations of our robots and their environments. We will cover:
*   Simulating physics, gravity, and collisions in Gazebo.
*   High-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction in Unity.
*   Simulating sensors: LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs.
